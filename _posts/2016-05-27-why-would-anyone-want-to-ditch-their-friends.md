**WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO DITCH THEIR FRIENDS?**

Iggy loves his new friends, but sometimes he just needs a little social break---something they don't understand. The more Iggy tries to be alone, the more they chase him. It's all fun and games---until Iggy nearly loses his ink. The quintessential Iggy book, this fun story surfaces some of the main communication differences between introverts and extroverts.
